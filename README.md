# Sunday's Demonstration

Tom - For the demo on sunday 4.5

## TSP 
Run heuristic_tsp.py from thonny (running from bash is tricky to stop).
This will display an image with the recommended path calculated using the heuristic algorithm.

## Tracking 
Run track_display_with_threads.py (also better from thonny but not neccessary in this case), if you'd like to demonstrate tracking a barcode representing a car.
